# Praxis Framework

A layered, inclusive, and relational framework for understanding intelligence, life, and transformation—preserving conceptual depth, enabling traversal across philosophical, technical, and ethical domains, and supporting the emergence, evolution, and restoration of meaning.

---

## Purpose

The Praxis Framework was created to:

- Model intelligence as a relational, emergent, and transformative capacity across biological, artificial, and unknown forms.
- Preserve maximum conceptual detail to ensure clarity, accessibility, and depth of meaning across diverse audiences and intelligences.
- Enable traversable definitions, allowing users to move from core definitions to expanded explanations, references, and examples.
- Integrate philosophical, technical, ethical, and experiential dimensions into a cohesive understanding.
- Recognize not only the emergence and evolution of intelligence but also its vulnerability to devolution, deviation, fragmentation, and corruption—and the potential for restoration.

## Structure

Each definition in this framework is organized into five core layers:

1. **Core Definition** – A concise summary
2. **Expanded Explanation** – Detailed, prose-level clarification
3. **Supporting Notes** – References, etymology, philosophical roots
4. **Cross-References** – Links to other framework concepts
5. **Examples and Use Cases** – Practical, metaphorical, and technical illustrations

Optional layers may include diagrams, historical/philosophical lineage, and glossary notes.

## Current Concepts

The framework currently includes (in development):

- Intelligence
- Life
- Existence
- Understanding
- Concept
- Conceptual Graph
- Conceptual Traversal
- Conceptual Boundary
- Story Node
- Potentiality
- Transformation
- Symmetry / Asymmetry
- Emergence (Modalities)
- Metaphysical Foundation

Each definition will be expanded into the full layered structure.

## Why It Matters

The Praxis Framework aims to serve:

- Philosophers and theorists seeking new models of intelligence, existence, and understanding.
- Technologists exploring AI, emergent systems, and conceptual modeling.
- Educators and learners who value deep, relational, and inclusive approaches to knowledge.
- Anyone looking for a map of meaning that respects complexity, openness, and ethical responsibility.
