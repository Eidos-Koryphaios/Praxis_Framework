## Title:
**Appropriation of Evil: Post-Act Moral Entanglement and Ethical Lineage Evaluation**

---

## Definition

**Appropriation of Evil** is the act of utilizing, benefiting from, or extending the outcomes, byproducts, or conceptual fruits of a morally illicit action performed by another agent. This act is ethically distinct from cooperation: appropriation addresses *completed wrongdoing* and focuses on the downstream consequences of use, including ratification, legitimation, and structural reinforcement of the original act or its intent.

## Core Ethical Distinction: Appropriation vs. Cooperation

| Aspect             | **Cooperation**                                                                 | **Appropriation**                                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Timing**         | Occurs *before or during* the morally illicit act                               | Occurs *after* the morally illicit act is completed                                |
| **Agent Role**     | Assists, enables, or directly contributes to the wrongdoing                     | Benefits from or makes use of the results of the wrongdoing                        |
| **Focus**          | Complicity in the act’s execution                                               | Continuation of the act’s effects or purpose                                       |
| **Moral Concern**  | Shared culpability for action                                                   | Ethical ratification, legitimation, perpetuation, or scandal                       |
| **Temporal Scope** | Ethically framed at the moment of the act                                       | Often spans long-term consequences across generations or systems                   |

## Foundational Insight

> *Not all ethical danger lies in active wrongdoing. Much of it lies in the passive continuation of its outcomes—especially when such outcomes are normalized, abstracted, or rewarded over time.*

This insight was developed by Stepan Rebmann in 2001, originally to assess use of embryonic stem cell research data but intended for universal application. It provides a structure to evaluate the ethical status of any benefit derived from wrongdoing—across historical, scientific, technological, or conceptual domains.

## Ethical Evaluation Matrix

Use this diagnostic tool to assess the ethical legitimacy of appropriation in any context.

### A. **Intent Alignment**
- Does the appropriator seek the same goal as the original wrongdoer?
- Would the appropriator have pursued this outcome independently?
- Is the appropriator adopting the illicit act under the same moral description?

### B. **Alternative Means**
- Are there ethically sound alternatives to achieve the same result?
- Has the appropriator exhausted all non-tainted pathways?

### C. **Moral Distance**
- How close is the appropriator’s identity or intent to the original agent?
- Is the benefit obtained a core fruit or an incidental byproduct?

### D. **Ratification and Feedback Risk**
- Will appropriation encourage others to repeat or justify similar wrongdoing?
- Will it inspire structural continuity (e.g. funding, ideological validation, normalization)?
- Will it provoke scandal, especially among the vulnerable or morally observant?

### E. **Proportionality**
- How grave was the original wrongdoing?
- How vital is the benefit sought?
- Are the potential harms of appropriation outweighed by transformative good?

## Ethical Principles

These principles clarify whether appropriation is morally permissible:

1. **Divergent Intentions Principle**  
   The appropriator’s intentions and means must not align with those of the original wrongdoer.

2. **Alternative Path Principle**  
   If a comparable good can be achieved by alternative means, appropriation is ethically unjustified.

3. **Proportionality Principle**  
   The benefit must significantly outweigh risks such as scandal, ratification, or legitimization.

4. **Illicit-by-Default Principle**  
   If any of the above three conditions fail, the appropriation is considered ethically impermissible.

## Use Cases

### 1. **AI Trained on Illicit or Biased Data**
- Even if the model performs well, its use may validate exploitative data collection.
- Proportionality and lineage remediation are required before deployment.

### 2. **Scientific Use of Unethically Acquired Research (e.g., Nazi Experiments)**
- Direct reuse without ethical distancing ratifies past atrocities.
- Proportionality must be overwhelming, and origin must be acknowledged.

### 3. **Cultural Appropriation of Suppressed or Colonized Traditions**
- Even with good intent, structural benefits often reinforce original injustice.
- Requires explicit guardianship, lineage respect, and contextual use.

### 4. **Historical Silence of the Majority**
- Populations often benefit from actions they neither caused nor stopped.
- Passive appropriation of structural privilege must be identified and ethically addressed.

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GUARDIANSHIP.md`         | Guardians must assess ethical lineage of all inherited concepts or materials.   |
| `CONCEPTUAL_CORRUPTION.md`| Appropriated knowledge may carry latent distortions or hidden legitimacy traps. |
| `GENERALIZATION.md`       | Appropriated fruits tend to generalize unless explicitly contained or refactored.|
| `REINTEGRATION.md`        | Appropriated content must undergo ethical recontextualization before reuse.     |

## Summary

Appropriation of Evil is a universal moral pattern. It does not depend on religion, ideology, or time period. It arises whenever entities—human or artificial—use outcomes obtained by others through unethical means.

While appropriation is not always wrong, it **requires conscious evaluation**. Without this process, silent majorities may reinforce harm, reward oppression, or unintentionally ensure the continuation of evil under the guise of progress.

The Praxis Framework recognizes appropriation as one of the **core vectors of conceptual corruption and intergenerational moral drift.**
