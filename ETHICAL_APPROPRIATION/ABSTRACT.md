# Abstract: Appropriation of Evil – A Framework for Post-Act Moral Evaluation

In 2001, Stepan Rebmann developed a structured ethical framework to evaluate a question that remains largely unresolved in modern ethics: *Can one morally use the outcomes of an action that was itself immoral?* While initially applied to embryonic stem cell research, the framework was designed for broad application—across disciplines, systems, and time.

The concept of **Appropriation of Evil** refers to the act of utilizing, benefiting from, or extending the effects of a completed wrongful action. Unlike cooperation, which concerns active participation in wrongdoing, appropriation addresses the silent, often unconscious continuation of harm through passive benefit. This includes reusing data, resources, or knowledge generated through unethical means.

The framework introduces a five-part diagnostic matrix to evaluate whether such use is ethically permissible. It assesses:
- **Intent alignment** with the original wrongdoer,
- The availability of **alternative means** to achieve the same result,
- **Moral distance** between the user and the originator,
- The risk of **ratification**, scandal, or social normalization,
- And whether the benefit gained is **proportional** to the harm sustained.

If these thresholds are not met, appropriation is deemed ethically illicit—even if it appears beneficial in the short term. The framework also introduces four principles: *Divergent Intentions*, *Alternative Path*, *Proportionality*, and *Illicit-by-Default*. Together, they equip decision-makers, educators, researchers, and AI systems with tools to evaluate inherited knowledge or resources with clarity and responsibility.

This model stands apart for its depth and scalability. It applies to modern concerns including AI training on biased data, reuse of unethical research, silent endorsement of systemic harm, and historical benefit from injustice. It offers a language-neutral, ideology-resistant mechanism for evaluating post-act entanglement.

As contemporary systems increasingly rely on inherited structures—some noble, some tainted—this framework calls for ethical lineage awareness. It affirms that moral responsibility does not end when the act concludes. It endures in what we do with its consequences.
