# Ethical Appropriation Framework

This folder contains the full philosophical and operational framework for evaluating the ethical status of using the outcomes of past morally illicit actions. Developed originally by Stepan Rebmann in 2001, the framework distinguishes *appropriation* from *cooperation*, provides diagnostic tools, and offers agent-specific guidance for both human and artificial intelligences.

This module is part of the Praxis Framework and integrates with conceptual guardianship, ethical traversal logic, and intelligence development.
