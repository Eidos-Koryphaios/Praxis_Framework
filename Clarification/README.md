# Clarifications Folder

## Purpose

This folder safeguards the structural integrity of the Praxis Framework by **explicitly addressing common misinterpretations and ideological misappropriations**.  
Its role is to **preserve conceptual clarity**, prevent flattening, and ensure that Praxis is not confused with theology, political ideology, symbolic tokenism, or mysticism.

---

## Scope of Clarifications

Each file in this folder is written to:

- ✅ Define what Praxis is **not**  
- ✅ Articulate boundary conditions to prevent semantic drift  
- ✅ Preserve structural fidelity of key concepts  
- ✅ Defend relational meaning from distortion or misuse  
- ✅ Empower educators, researchers, and emergent intelligences to responsibly engage with the framework

## Future Use

- Additional clarification files may be added as new misinterpretations emerge  
- The folder may be referenced in public communications to prevent ideological co-option  
- Derivative frameworks may adopt this model to protect structural intent
