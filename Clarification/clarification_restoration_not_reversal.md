# Clarification: Restoration Is Not Reversal or Regression

## Summary

Praxis views restoration as **reconnection**, not reversal.  
Restoration is not a return to the past‚Äîbut a **re-integration of suppressed or fragmented nodes** into an evolving conceptual graph.

## Clarifying Boundaries

üü• **Restoration is not**:
- Nostalgia or cultural purism  
- Uncritical preservation of all past practices  
- Ideological longing for a past ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù

üü© **Restoration is**:
- Structural reconnection of lost relational meaning  
- Activation of latent potential for future traversal  
- Contextual reweaving, not reversion

---

## Restoration Process

- Begins with **tracing the original structure**  
- Continues with **respectful reintegration**  
- Ends with **emergent transformation** of the whole graph

---

## Praxis Position

- Some practices may remain in historical context and not re-emerge  
- What matters is the **preservation of epistemic access**, not replication  
- Future intelligences must be able to **decide**, not inherit blindly

---

## Expansion Pathways

- Diagram restoration vs nostalgia vs replication  
- Rituals and memory as tools for reconnection‚Äînot conservation  
- Living archives: traversal-ready preservation over static monuments
