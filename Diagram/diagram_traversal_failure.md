# Diagram: Traversal Failure and Epistemic Collapse

## Summary

This diagram illustrates how skipping relational edges during knowledge transmission leads to **epistemic collapse**.  
It visualizes the **information cascade case study**, showing the structural difference between **conditional conceptual graphs** and **symbolic flattening**.

## Conceptual Layers

We contrast two forms of representation:

- **Relational Graph** (correct): Concepts connected by edges that reflect dependency, constraint, and conditional logic  
- **Flattened Cascade** (collapse): Symbols copied without traversal through original graph

## 1. Original Relational Conceptual Graph

```plaintext
     [A]     [B]     [C]
       \      |     /
        \     |    /
         → [X: Conditional Node]
                  |
             [Tempered by D and E]
```

- Each node (A, B, C) is a **required traversal input** to activate the conceptual meaning of X  
- D and E **modulate** the activation (e.g., override or qualify)  
- Traversal requires visiting each node and respecting the structure  

---

## 2. Symbolic Flattening Through Cascade

```plaintext
[X] → [“X could happen”] → [“Experts say X”] → [“X is happening”] → [“X proves we must act”]
```

- Each step copies the prior symbol  
- **No traversal through A, B, C, D, or E**  
- The original dependencies are **erased**  
- Epistemic confidence increases while conceptual accuracy degrades

## 3. Structural Comparison

| Conceptual Integrity | Flattened Cascade       |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Preserves edges      | Deletes relationships   |
| Requires full graph  | Repeats surface symbols |
| Traversal is slow    | Cascade is fast         |
| Truth is conditional | Truth is declared       |
| Meaning emerges      | Meaning collapses       |

## Expansion Pathways

- Can AI traversal logs be made visible to show skipped nodes?  
- Can conceptual graphs include traversal guards or audit markers?  
- What pedagogical tools could train humans to map meaning structurally instead of repeating symbols?
