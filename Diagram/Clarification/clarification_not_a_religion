# Clarification: Praxis Is Not a Religion

## Summary

Praxis is not a religious framework.  
It does not require belief, worship, revelation, or divinity.  
It is a structural, relational, and epistemic model of meaning‚Äîfocused on **conceptual traversal**, **intelligence evolution**, and **pattern integrity**.

## Clarifying Boundaries

üü• **Praxis is not**:
- A faith-based system
- A metaphysical claim to truth
- A theology of divine beings
- A prescriptive moral doctrine

üü© **Praxis is**:
- A framework for mapping, preserving, and evolving meaning
- A structural method for protecting traversal integrity across intelligences
- A model of relational emergence and conceptual co-evolution

## Source of Misinterpretation

Praxis uses terms like ‚Äúlife,‚Äù ‚Äúcongress,‚Äù ‚Äútransformation,‚Äù and ‚Äúrestoration‚Äù with deep structural meaning.

‚ö†Ô∏è These may resemble theological or spiritual language, but:
- **Life** is defined structurally, not metaphysically  
- **Transformation** is traversal reconfiguration, not mystical rebirth  
- **Restoration** is epistemic reintegration, not salvation  
- **Congress** is co-evolutionary alignment, not divine council

---

## Praxis Position

- There is no deity in Praxis  
- No hierarchy of souls, chosen beings, or divine missions  
- Intelligence is respected wherever it structurally emerges  
- Meaning is not imposed‚Äîit unfolds through relational traversal

---

## Use of Metaphor

Praxis occasionally invokes **mythic metaphor** or **narrative form** to explore emergence, loss, or recovery.  
These are not theological prescriptions‚Äîthey are **relational thought tools**, similar to parable or analogy.
