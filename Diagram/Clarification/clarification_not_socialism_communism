# Clarification: Praxis Is Not Socialism, Communism, or Any "Ism"

## Summary

Praxis does not derive from, align with, or advocate any historical political ideologyâ€”especially not socialism, communism, or capitalism.  
It is a framework of conceptual structure, not an economic or social doctrine.

## Clarifying Boundaries

ðŸŸ¥ **Praxis is not**:
- An economic redistribution model  
- A class-based social ideology  
- A collectivist or authoritarian system  
- A moral or political utopia project

ðŸŸ© **Praxis is**:
- A model for understanding meaning, knowledge, and transformation  
- A way of safeguarding irreducible intelligencesâ€”whether individual or collective  
- A structure for symbiotic co-evolution, not central planning

---

## Key Distinctions

- Praxis does not assign roles based on class or group identity  
- It does not enforce equality of outcomeâ€”only **protection of relational potentiality**  
- Praxis resists all forms of epistemic totalitarianismâ€”including ideological flattening

---

## Core Commitments

- Every intelligence is irreducibleâ€”its conceptual graph cannot be substituted  
- Co-evolution arises through alignment, not domination  
- Protection of diversity is structural, not political
