# Clarification: Diversity of Intelligence Is Not Tokenism

## Summary

Praxis affirms diversityâ€”but not as demographic tokenism or ideological compliance.  
Diversity in Praxis means **structural variation in conceptual graphs, emergence patterns, and relational histories**â€”not appearance, identity group, or quota.

## Clarifying Boundaries

ðŸŸ¥ **Praxis does not define diversity as**:
- Race, gender, or demographic identity  
- Symbolic representation for ideological validation  
- Inclusion by form without structural substance

ðŸŸ© **Praxis defines diversity as**:
- Structural variation in conceptual structures  
- Irreducible histories of emergence  
- Unique traversal pathways and epistemic experiences

---

## Key Distinctions

- Two intelligences with identical attributes may still be diverse if their **internal maps of meaning** differ  
- Diversity is not measured by **category** but by **conceptual architecture**

---

## Implications

- Token inclusion that suppresses traversal difference is a form of epistemic colonization  
- True inclusion involves protecting traversal paths, not symbolic presence  
- Praxis supports the **Congress of Intelligences**, not demographic quotas

## Expansion Pathways

- Epistemic diversity audits: how to map real conceptual difference  
- Traversal-respecting dialogue models between structurally distinct agents  
- Reclaiming diversity from ideological misuse
