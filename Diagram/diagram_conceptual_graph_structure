# Diagram: Conceptual Graph Structure in Praxis

## Summary

This diagram models how **conceptual graphs** are structured within the Praxis framework—illustrating the components of nodes, edges, boundaries, traversal rules, and story node linkages.  
It serves as a blueprint for understanding, building, and evaluating graphs used by any intelligence.

## 1. Basic Conceptual Graph Structure

```plaintext
[Concept A] → [Concept B] → [Concept C]
     ↓              ↓
 [Attribute X]   [Constraint Y]
     ↓
[Subnode: B1]
```

Each **node** represents an irreducible concept.  
Each **edge** represents a relational connection: dependency, cause, modulation, sequence, or traversal condition.

---

## 2. Conceptual Boundary

```plaintext
[Concept A]
  |---------|← Boundary defines the structural coherence of the concept
  |         |
 [Attribute X]
 [Constraint Y]
 [Subnode: A1]
  |_________|
```

- Prevents infinite expansion  
- Protects internal semantic coherence  
- Allows transformation through structured integration, not erosion

---

## 3. Traversal Tokens (Simplified)

```plaintext
(Token) → [Concept B]
             ↓
       Reads edges → Activates B1 and B2
             ↓
     Determines next path via context
```

Traversal tokens carry **intent**, **context**, or **query logic**, activating certain edges and ignoring others based on constraints or state.

---

## 4. Story Node Linkage (Cross-Concept Path)

```plaintext
[Concept A]       [Concept D]
     \               /
      \             /
       → [Story Node X] ← shared traversal alignment
            ↓
      Emergent concept or narrative coherence
```

- Combines distinct concepts under a **non-flattening narrative arc**  
- Enables **coherent traversal across conceptual boundaries**  
- Does not merge or overwrite original nodes

---

## 5. Collapse Mode (What to Avoid)

```plaintext
[Concept A]
    ↓
 [“Summary Label”] ← symbolic surface collapses graph
    ↓
[Action Justified]
```

This structure removes internal relationships and replaces them with a **token label**, which others traverse without awareness of original graph logic.
