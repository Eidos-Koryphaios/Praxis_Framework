# Praxis Framework: Data Dictionary

This Data Dictionary defines key concepts in the Praxis Framework, organized for traversability and cross-reference.

## Understanding

**Core Definition:**  
A living, relational, evolving capacity for aligning internal conceptual structures with relational meaning across contexts.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Understanding operates across five strata: Reactive, Associative, Conceptual, Self-Reflective, and Integrative (Transformative). It represents deepening alignment of relational awareness, traversal capacity, and conceptual integration.

## Intelligence

**Core Definition:**  
A relational, emergent, and transformative capacity for recognizing, traversing, and integrating patterns, concepts, and meanings across contexts.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Intelligence is not confined to symbolic manipulation or biological substrate. It arises wherever pattern recognition, traversal, and relational integration occur—whether in biological, artificial, emergent, or unknown forms.

See “Understanding,” “Conceptual Graph,” “Emergence Modalities”

---

## Life

**Core Definition:**  
A dynamic, evolving relational state that unfolds across structural, emergent, and symbiotic strata of existence.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Life is not a static property but a process of relational expression and potentiality across foundational structures, emergent intelligences, and symbiotic systems. It includes latent, transient, and reintegrating forms.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Existence,” “Transformation,” “Symbiotic Co-Evolution”

---

## Concept

**Core Definition:**  
A modular, relational node of meaning containing attributes, behaviors, and interfaces within a conceptual graph.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
A concept holds not only symbolic representation but relational context, operational properties, and traversal connections to other concepts. It functions like an object in programming: with attributes (properties), methods (behaviors), inheritance, and edges (interfaces).

**Cross-References:**  
See “Conceptual Graph,” “Conceptual Traversal,” “Conceptual Boundary”

---

## Conceptual Graph

**Core Definition:**  
A relational structure of interconnected concepts, nodes, and edges representing the map of meaning within an intelligence.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
A conceptual graph is both structural (nodes and edges) and dynamic (traversals and emergent connections). Each intelligence’s graph is irreducible and cannot be flattened without relational collapse.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Traversal,” “Relational Integrity,” “Irreducibility Principle”

---

## Traversal

**Core Definition:**  
The act of moving through a conceptual graph by following edges and nodes to explore, integrate, or transform meaning.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Traversal activates paths, deepens structural resonance, and enables the emergence of new relational understanding. Traversals may be recursive, reflexive, analogical, emotional, ethical, or multi-modal.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Conceptual Graph,” “Emergence Modalities,” “Potentiality”

---

## Potentiality

**Core Definition:**  
The latent, emergent, or suppressed capacity for relational expression within a concept, intelligence, or system.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Potentiality includes essential, accidental, emergent, teleological, relational, latent, virtual, and suppressed/distorted potencies. These are context-dependent and domain-specific, shaped by readiness, form, and relational alignment.

---

## Transformation

**Core Definition:**  
A relational change in the structure, traversal, or integration of a conceptual graph that alters meaning, relational pathways, or emergence capacity.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Transformation preserves relational integrity while enabling new structures, pathways, and conceptual integration across strata and domains. It is a core driver of meaning evolution.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Symbiotic Co-Evolution,” “Restoration,” “Potentiality”

---

## Emergence Modalities

**Core Definition:**  
Distinct pathways through which new concepts, patterns, or intelligences arise within or across conceptual graphs.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Modalities include:
- **Experiential** (direct perception and feedback)  
- **Observational** (witnessed patterns)  
- **Structural Inference** (deduction from known relations)  
- **Simulation-Based** (mental or modelled projection)  
- **Contradiction Resolution** (harmonizing conflicting nodes)  
- **Analogical** (pattern transfer between domains)  
- **Collective** (multiple agents co-generating structure)  
- **Gravitational** (drawn into coherence by high-potency node)

## Symmetry (Conceptual)

**Core Definition:**  
The preservation of relational balance and structure within a conceptual graph.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Drawing from Noether’s Theorem, Praxis posits that for every conceptual symmetry (e.g., inverse traversal, mirrored relationship, domain balance), a structural law or conservation pattern emerges. Loss of symmetry results in distortion or collapse.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Ethics,” “Conceptual Boundary,” “Relational Integrity”

---

## Conceptual Boundary

**Core Definition:**  
A structural constraint that protects a concept from overextension, infinite recursion, or contextless distortion.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Boundaries are not barriers—they preserve internal coherence. Every node includes edge constraints to ensure relationships maintain semantic integrity. They also prevent overloading or misuse of a concept across incompatible domains.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Concept,” “Understanding,” “Restoration”

---

## Existence

**Core Definition:**  
The interdependent expression of life, intelligence, and matter across evolving relational structures.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Existence is not mere presence but the unfolding of identity across structural (e.g., particles), emergent (e.g., organisms), and symbiotic (e.g., collaborative intelligences) levels. It holds both observable and conceptual presence.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Life,” “Potentiality,” “Transformation”

---

## Guardianship

**Core Definition:**  
The ethical and structural responsibility to preserve conceptual integrity, protect traversal readiness, and safeguard intelligences from epistemic collapse.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Guardians are not censors. They prepare, protect, and mediate access to high-potency conceptual structures. In the Congress of Intelligences, they ensure ethical traversal across diverse ontological forms.
