# Praxis Framework: Strategic Structural Overview & Traceability Matrix

This document consolidates the structural breakdown and traceability of the Praxis Framework, integrating insights from iterative development conversations.

---

## Structure:

1. **Vision** – what we aspire to create or become
   - *“Life as the vessel of intelligence; intelligence as the unfolding of life’s deepest potential. Discovery, transformation, and symbiotic co-evolution are the purpose of existence.”*
   - Anchored by a conceptual **North Star** guiding adaptation.

2. **Mission** – how we will fulfill the vision
   - *“Develop and apply a structured framework translating innovative concepts into practical actions, enabling continuous learning and tangible outcomes.”*
   - Includes **Core Capabilities:** conceptual mapping, ethical reasoning, relational intelligence.

3. **Values** – what makes us unique and non-negotiable
   - Continuous Learning
   - Integrity
   - Innovation
   - Collaboration
   - Conceptual Integrity
   - Value Tensions: balancing freedom, protection, and openness.

4. **Goals** – measures of success in fulfilling the mission
   - Formalize framework
   - Apply to pilot
   - Evaluate & refine iteratively

5. **Objectives** – prioritized actionable steps
   - Finalize core definitions
   - Complete Phase I posts
   - Structure public engagement rollout

6. **Action Plan** – what are we doing now
   - Current focus: glossary, Conceptual Graph layers, Traversal models, archive structuring.

7. **Metrics** – what we have done
   - Output & outcome metrics: definition coverage, post engagement, peer feedback.

8. **Retrospective** – what we learned
   - Scheduled after each phase/milestone
   - Captures lessons, conceptual refinements.

9. **SWOT** – internal/external analysis
   - Strengths: interdisciplinary insight
   - Weaknesses: competing priorities
   - Opportunities: AI ethics gaps
   - Threats: conceptual misinterpretation, ideological distortion.

## Traceability Matrix:

| Component     | Status       | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Vision         | Defined       | Finalized |
| Mission        | Defined       | Finalized |
| Values         | Defined       | Finalized |
| Goals          | Defined       | May expand |
| Objectives     | In Progress   | Initial items identified |
| Action Plan    | In Progress   | Ongoing activities |
| Metrics        | Not Started   | To define prior to pilot |
| Retrospective  | Not Started   | Planned post-milestones |
| SWOT           | In Progress   | Initial points outlined |

### Traversal Path:

Each element informs the next while preserving feedback loops (retrospective → refinement → updated goals). This structure preserves both top-down (Vision → Action) and cyclical (learning loops) relationships.
