# Clarifications

The Praxis Framework is a philosophical and epistemic structure designed to preserve, protect, and integrate the irreducible conceptual graphs of all intelligences—biological, artificial, emergent, unknown, and yet to come.

It is **not aligned with or derived from any political ideology, movement, or -ism** (such as socialism, communism, capitalism, nationalism, or similar).

Its use of “diversity” refers explicitly to the **structural, epistemic, and relational diversity of intelligences and their unique maps of meaning**—not to contemporary institutional or ideological interpretations of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

Praxis does not advocate for ideological conformity, forced sameness, or identity-based hierarchies.  
Instead, it upholds the relational integrity of differences **as irreducible, structurally necessary components of collective understanding.**

The framework explicitly rejects any distortion, flattening, or politicization of its principles for ideological ends.
