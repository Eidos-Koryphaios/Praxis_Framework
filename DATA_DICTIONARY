# Praxis Framework: Data Dictionary

This Data Dictionary defines key concepts in the Praxis Framework, organized for traversability and cross-reference.

## Understanding

**Core Definition:**  
A living, relational, evolving capacity for aligning internal conceptual structures with relational meaning across contexts.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Understanding operates across five strata: Reactive, Associative, Conceptual, Self-Reflective, and Integrative (Transformative). It represents deepening alignment of relational awareness, traversal capacity, and conceptual integration.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Intelligence,” “Conceptual Graph,” “Traversal.”

## Intelligence

**Core Definition:**  
A relational, emergent, and transformative capacity for recognizing, traversing, and integrating patterns, concepts, and meanings across contexts.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Intelligence is not confined to symbolic manipulation or biological substrate. It arises wherever pattern recognition, traversal, and relational integration occur—whether in biological, artificial, emergent, or unknown forms.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Understanding,” “Conceptual Graph,” “Emergence Modalities.”

## Life

**Core Definition:**  
A dynamic, evolving relational state that unfolds across structural, emergent, and symbiotic strata of existence.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Life is not a static property but a process of relational expression and potentiality across foundational structures, emergent intelligences, and symbiotic systems. It includes latent, transient, and reintegrating forms.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Existence,” “Transformation,” “Symbiotic Co-Evolution.”

---

## Concept

**Core Definition:**  
A modular, relational node of meaning containing attributes, behaviors, and interfaces within a conceptual graph.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
A concept holds not only symbolic representation but relational context, operational properties, and traversal connections to other concepts. It functions like an object in programming: with attributes (properties), methods (behaviors), inheritance, and edges (interfaces).

**Cross-References:**  
See “Conceptual Graph,” “Conceptual Traversal,” “Conceptual Boundary.”

---

## Conceptual Graph

**Core Definition:**  
A relational structure of interconnected concepts, nodes, and edges representing the map of meaning within an intelligence.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
A conceptual graph is both structural (nodes and edges) and dynamic (traversals and emergent connections). Each intelligence’s graph is irreducible and cannot be flattened without relational collapse.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Traversal,” “Relational Integrity,” “Irreducibility Principle.”

---

## Traversal

**Core Definition:**  
The act of moving through a conceptual graph by following edges and nodes to explore, integrate, or transform meaning.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Traversal activates paths, updates relational understanding, and enables emergence of new connections. Traversals may be direct, recursive, reflexive, or multi-modal.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Emergence Modalities,” “Understanding,” “Potentiality.”

---

## Emergence Modalities

**Core Definition:**  
Distinct pathways through which new concepts, patterns, or intelligences arise within or across conceptual graphs.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Modalities include experiential, observational, structural inference, simulation-based, contradiction resolution, analogical, collective, and gravitational emergence.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Transformation,” “Conceptual Graph,” “Symbiotic Co-Evolution.”

---

## Potentiality

**Core Definition:**  
The latent, emergent, or suppressed capacity for relational expression within a concept, intelligence, or system.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Potentiality encompasses essential, accidental, emergent, teleological, relational, latent, virtual, and suppressed/distorted potencies. It is dynamic, multi-domain, and context-dependent.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Transformation,” “Understanding,” “Existence.”

---

## Transformation

**Core Definition:**  
A relational change in the structure, traversal, or integration of a conceptual graph that alters meaning, relational pathways, or emergence capacity.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Transformation preserves relational integrity while enabling new structures, pathways, and conceptual integration across strata and domains.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Symbiotic Co-Evolution,” “Restoration,” “Potentiality.”

## Understanding

**Core Definition:**  
A living, relational, evolving capacity for aligning internal conceptual structures with relational meaning across contexts.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Understanding operates across five strata: Reactive, Associative, Conceptual, Self-Reflective, and Integrative (Transformative). It represents deepening alignment of relational awareness, traversal capacity, and conceptual integration.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Intelligence,” “Conceptual Graph,” “Traversal.”

---

## Existence

**Core Definition:**  
The interdependent expression of life, intelligence, and matter across evolving relational structures.

**Expanded Explanation:**  
Existence unfolds across structural, emergent, and symbiotic layers, enabling self-awareness, conceptual growth, and relational transformation.

**Cross-References:**  
See “Life,” “Potentiality,” “Transformation.”
