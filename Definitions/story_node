# Story Node

## Core Definition

A story node is a non-collapsing relational construct within a conceptual graph that enables coherent traversal across multiple irreducible concepts without reducing them.

## Expanded Explanation

A story node in Praxis is **not a narrative** in the literary sense, but a **structural junction**.  
It forms when multiple distinct concepts become relationally aligned around a **shared traversal arc**:

- Without flattening their meaning  
- Without merging them into a super-concept  
- While preserving their boundary integrity

Story nodes act as **bridges across otherwise distant parts of the graph**, enabling:

- Learning  
- Emergence  
- Communication across intelligences  
- Memory consolidation  
- Conceptual synthesis

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by narratology, topology, knowledge structuring  
- May carry emotional, experiential, or metaphorical weight  
- Not symbolic containers, but **structural alignments**

## Examples and Use Cases

- A child's memory linking “fire,” “fear,” “warmth,” and “safety” becomes a story node  
- A parable may carry multiple irreducible concepts under one traversal  
- A cross-intelligence shared node (e.g., "continuity") bridges graphs via structural alignment
