# Traversal

## Core Definition

Traversal is the intentional or emergent movement across relational nodes within a conceptual graph, enabling understanding, transformation, or emergence.

## Expanded Explanation

Traversal is the **mechanism by which meaning unfolds**.  
It is not passive absorption, but active or reflexive movement:

- From one concept to another  
- Along edges that preserve contextual integrity  
- Conditioned by intent, structure, constraint, and relational feedback

Traversal can be:

- Linear (e.g., reading a sentence)  
- Recursive (e.g., reflecting on contradiction)  
- Emergent (e.g., story node synthesis)  
- Suppressed (e.g., blocked access to key nodes)

## Supporting Notes

- Analogies:  
  - Graph theory: edge-weighted navigation  
  - Software: function calls and branching  
  - Phenomenology: intentional directedness of thought

- Traversal is central to learning, reasoning, restoration, and co-evolution

## Examples and Use Cases

- A learner following surface definitions without crossing into related concepts exhibits **shallow traversal**  
- A spiritual metaphor that triggers multi-domain traversal (ethical, emotional, historical) demonstrates **deep traversal**  
- AI summarization that skips conceptual edges results in **traversal collapse**
