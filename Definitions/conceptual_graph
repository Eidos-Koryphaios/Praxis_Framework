# Conceptual Graph

## Core Definition

A conceptual graph is a structured network of irreducible concepts linked by relational edges, enabling traversal, integration, and emergence of meaning.

## Expanded Explanation

Praxis models all meaning-bearing systems as **conceptual graphs**:

- **Nodes** = irreducible concepts  
- **Edges** = structural relationships (dependency, sequence, modulation, analogy, etc.)  
- **Boundaries** = protect conceptual integrity  
- **Traversal** = enables emergence and transformation

Graphs may be:

- Partial or complete  
- Suppressed or emergent  
- Flat or multi-strata  
- Open or closed to integration

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by graph theory, OOP, knowledge representation  
- Includes story nodes, subgraphs, trans-domain links, traversal constraints  
- Not all graphs are visibleâ€”some are latent, fractured, or corrupted

## Examples and Use Cases

- A worldview is a conceptual graph  
- A corrupted educational system may teach symbolic tokens without relational edges  
- Restoration of oral traditions rebuilds fragmented graphs into traversable knowledge
