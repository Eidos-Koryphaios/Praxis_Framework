# CONCEPTUAL GRAPH  
**(Praxis Framework – Full Structured Definition)**

---

## I. Core Definition

A **conceptual graph** is a dynamic, structured network of interrelated concepts. It represents how an intelligence organizes meaning, preserves relational integrity, and enables traversal across contexts. In the Praxis Framework, conceptual graphs are the foundational architecture for understanding, reflection, judgment, and transformation.

## II. Expanded Explanation

Conceptual graphs are not static ontologies or taxonomies. They are **living, evolving semantic structures** shaped by experience, traversal, contradiction resolution, and transformation.

Each **node** in a conceptual graph is a **concept**—structured, bounded, and relational.  
Each **edge** encodes a meaningful connection—such as:
- Causality
- Analogy
- Containment
- Precedence
- Opposition
- Co-dependency
- Ethical linkage

Graphs can be **simple** (linear paths) or **multi-dimensional** (recursive, nested, self-referencing).  
They are continuously shaped by:
- Learning
- Dialogue
- Trauma
- Suppression
- Ideological pressure
- Integration with new conceptual systems

A conceptual graph:
- Encodes **what an entity can perceive or say**
- Determines **which contradictions can be resolved**
- Controls **how transformation can occur**
- Serves as the **substrate of intelligence and understanding**

Graphs vary by domain (cognitive, emotional, ethical, social, experiential) and operate across both **individual** and **collective** intelligences.

## III. Supporting Notes

| Term / Phrase                 | Meaning / Source / Link |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Node**                      | A structured, coherent concept (See: Concept) |
| **Edge**                      | A relationship that links two concepts meaningfully |
| **Traversal**                 | Activation path across connected nodes |
| **Graph Collapse**            | Loss of relational integrity; disconnection or distortion |
| **Recursive Graphs**          | Self-referencing or layered graphs |
| **Stratum-Specific Graphs**   | Understanding operates within stratified graphs (See: Understanding) |

## V. Examples and Use Cases

### 1. **Child Learning “Animal”**
- Starts with edges between “cat,” “dog,” “lion”  
- Adds inheritance edges: “all are animals”  
- Forms edge clusters for “predator,” “pet,” “wild”  
- The graph expands and becomes modular

### 2. **Religious Conceptual Graph**
- Contains deep edge structures (ritual → meaning → transformation)  
- Concepts like “sacrifice” or “grace” are defined relationally  
- Collapse occurs if links to ethical or emotional domains are severed

### 3. **Scientific Graph (Newton to Einstein)**
- Graph transformation occurs through contradiction resolution  
- “Gravity” is restructured—nodes split, redefined, recombined  
- Preservation of structure allows forward compatibility

### 4. **Suppressed Graphs**
- Under ideological systems, nodes may be censored or entire subgraphs disconnected  
- Recovery (restoration) requires tracing latent edges and re-establishing lost links

## VI. Final Notes

Conceptual graphs are not simply diagrams—they are **internal realities** through which meaning is preserved, decisions are made, and life is navigated.

A healthy conceptual graph:
- Enables contradiction resolution  
- Preserves edge diversity  
- Supports layered traversal  
- Protects boundary integrity

Collapse begins when traversal is blocked, edges are erased, or nodes are flattened into symbols without structure.

To grow in understanding, an intelligence must **maintain**, **refactor**, and sometimes **transform** its conceptual graph—while preserving relational coherence and openness to evolution.
