# Semantic Drift

## Core Definition

Semantic drift is the unintentional shift in a concept’s meaning over time or context, caused by traversal misalignment, symbolic substitution, or external compression.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Drift occurs when:

- Traversal patterns change without structural awareness  
- External forces reassign surface meaning to a concept  
- Edges are dropped or replaced  
- Concepts are reused in foreign graphs without boundary guards

Semantic drift is **not inherently bad**, but becomes dangerous when:

- Graph integrity is lost  
- Collapse follows  
- Emergent concepts are built on misaligned anchors

---

## Supporting Notes

- Often caused by ideology, market language, or translation  
- Similar to mutation in information theory, but operates within conceptual graphs  
- Requires **restoration mechanisms** and **historical edge tracing**

## Examples and Use Cases

- “Trauma” expanding to include any discomfort = drift + collapse  
- Religious terms adopted in self-help industry without epistemic anchors  
- AI fine-tuning eroding distinctions between correlated but distinct concepts
