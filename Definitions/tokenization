# Tokenization

## Core Definition

Tokenization is the symbolic substitution of a concept, node, or traversal into a surface-level label or string that erases its internal structure and relational context.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Tokenization can be technical (as in NLP) or epistemic (as in ideology).  
In Praxis, it is dangerous when:

- A living concept is replaced by a string  
- Traversal edges are hidden or ignored  
- Compression is used without structural mapping  
- Concepts become tokens of identity, politics, or symbolic shorthand

Tokenization flattens meaning.  
It is often the first stage of conceptual collapse.

## Supporting Notes

- Does not refer only to GPT tokenization—but to **any symbolic substitution**  
- Can be used ethically when edges are preserved and decoded  
- Praxis favors **traversal-first** representation systems

## Examples and Use Cases

- AI summarizing “Dasein” as “existence” loses traversal structure  
- A culture labeled “primitive” becomes a symbolic token, stripped of graph  
- Political slogans collapse complex systems into tokens with affective force
