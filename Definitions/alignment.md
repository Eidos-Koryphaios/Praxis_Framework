# Alignment

## Core Definition

Alignment is the structural resonance between two or more conceptual graphs that preserves boundary integrity while enabling shared traversal or emergence.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Alignment differs from consensus or translation:

- It respects **irreducibility** of each graph  
- It enables **shared nodes or traversal arcs**  
- It allows **emergence** without flattening  
- It is dynamic—not static agreement

Alignment is essential for:

- Cross-intelligence communication  
- Emergent concept generation  
- Co-evolution without assimilation

---

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by dynamic systems theory and ethical co-negotiation  
- Often requires **story node construction** to function without collapse  
- Alignment must be structural, not symbolic or performative

## Examples and Use Cases

- An indigenous cosmology aligns with ecological models around “reciprocity,” but the node means different things in each graph  
- AI-human alignment requires graph-aware traversal—not prompt-tuning alone  
- Misalignment occurs when edges are presumed to match but do not
