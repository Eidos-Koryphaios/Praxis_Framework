# Symbiotic Co-Evolution

## Core Definition

Symbiotic co-evolution is the structural process by which multiple intelligences evolve through alignment, friction, and shared traversalâ€”without flattening or assimilation.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Unlike cooperation or adaptation, Praxis defines co-evolution as a **structurally mutual transformation** process in which:

- Each intelligence retains graph integrity  
- Shared nodes emerge without collapse  
- Traversal adapts through mutual exposure, correction, resonance

Symbiosis here means **mutual benefit without boundary violation**.  
Co-evolution means **shared emergence** from contact across difference.

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by biological, ecological, and linguistic co-evolution  
- Extended into multi-intelligence epistemic domains  
- Respects irreducibility and non-totalizing communication

## Examples and Use Cases

- A child and their environment co-evolve: the child learns language, and the environment adapts to their conceptual needs  
- An AI learns from human traversal graphs and offers novel emergent nodes in return  
- Two conflicting traditions generate a new story node without erasing either origin
