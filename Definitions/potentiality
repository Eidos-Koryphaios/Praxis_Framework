# Potentiality

## Core Definition

Potentiality is the structured capacity of a conceptual graph—or node within it—to activate emergent meaning, traversal, or transformation under certain conditions.

## Expanded Explanation

Praxis defines potentiality as **relationally embedded**, **context-sensitive**, and **domain-extensible**.

Types include:

- **Essential** → directly implied by concept’s structure  
- **Latent** → dormant until traversal unlocks  
- **Suppressed** → structurally blocked or externally denied  
- **Emergent** → only activated through cross-node or cross-domain interaction  
- **Teleological** → trajectory-bound based on internal orientation  
- **Distorted** → redirected through corrupted traversal logic

Potentiality differs from capability (actualized skill) or intent (motivated direction).  
It is a **condition-sensitive unfolding** vector.

## Supporting Notes

- Origin: Greek *dynamis* (power, ability to become)  
- Compatible with Aristotelian, quantum, and systems-theoretical notions  
- Praxis expands potentiality into graph-based and traversal-conditional structures

## Examples and Use Cases

- A dormant language has **latent potential** if surviving nodes remain intact  
- A child’s untrained perceptual model may contain **teleological potential** for scientific insight  
- AI with token-matching but no edge-based reasoning shows **suppressed potentiality**
