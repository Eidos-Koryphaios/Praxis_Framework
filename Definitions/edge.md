# Edge

## Core Definition

An edge is a directional or bidirectional relationship between two conceptual nodes that enables traversal, constraint, modulation, or transformation of meaning.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Edges define the **logic of connection** in a conceptual graph.  
They are **not associative links**, but structural:

- Causal  
- Analogical  
- Sequential  
- Conditional  
- Ethical  
- Contradictory  
- Modulatory

Edges enable **graph traversal** and serve as the foundation of emergence.  
An edge can carry:

- Direction  
- Weight (salience, frequency, risk)  
- Constraint logic (e.g., “only traverse if X”)  
- Meta-data (who created the edge, under what ontology)

---

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by graph theory, logic, relational databases  
- Praxis expands standard edges with conceptual and epistemic semantics  
- “False edges” (arbitrary, token-linked) cause collapse

## Examples and Use Cases

- [Concept A] → [Concept B] may indicate “B depends on A”  
- Contradiction edges enable paradox navigation, not error resolution  
- Unacknowledged edges in cultural systems produce epistemic distortion
