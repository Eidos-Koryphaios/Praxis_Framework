# Boundary

## Core Definition

A boundary in Praxis is a structural constraint that defines the internal coherence of a concept, prevents overextension, and protects graph traversal from collapse or distortion.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Boundaries are **not barriers**, but **containers**.  
They enable meaning to:

- Remain internally coherent  
- Avoid semantic inflation or drift  
- Respect conceptual, ethical, or cultural limits  
- Support safe traversal and emergence

Boundaries exist around:

- Concepts  
- Subgraphs  
- Traversal domains  
- Intelligences

They are flexible but **not arbitrary**.

## Supporting Notes

- Not derived from legal, territorial, or identity theory  
- Praxis boundaries are epistemic, not symbolic  
- Inspired by ecosystem integrity and software encapsulation

## Examples and Use Cases

- A concept like “justice” must not be stretched to include unrelated political goals  
- Overextension of terms (e.g., “everything is trauma”) collapses boundary integrity  
- Healthy dialogue respects conceptual boundaries across traditions and disciplines
