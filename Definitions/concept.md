# CONCEPT  
**(Praxis Framework – Full Structured Definition)**

---

## I. Core Definition

A **concept** is a structurally coherent, relationally embedded node of meaning. In the Praxis Framework, concepts are not arbitrary labels or disembodied ideas—they are **modular entities** with defined attributes, behaviors, boundaries, and relationships. Concepts persist within conceptual graphs and derive meaning through traversal, integration, and alignment with other nodes.

---

## II. Expanded Explanation

Concepts are the fundamental units of meaning and structure. They are **not passive labels**, but **active architectures** of relational information.

In Praxis, a concept includes:

- **Attributes** – internal properties or dimensions (e.g., color, size, cause, class)  
- **Behaviors (Semantic Methods)** – actions or transformations a concept can express (e.g., combine, compare, replicate)  
- **Inheritance** – concepts may extend other concepts, inheriting structure while adding or overriding meaning  
- **Interfaces (Edges)** – defined connections to other concepts that give them meaning in context  
- **Boundaries** – the internal structural constraints that prevent conceptual collapse or overextension  
- **Traversal Readiness** – the ability of a concept to be entered, queried, linked, recombined, or transformed  

Concepts are **modular** and **recursive**. They can contain other concepts (composite), be traversed in sequences (narrative), and function across domains (cognitive, ethical, experiential, etc.).

A concept is **not reducible to a symbol**—it is defined by structure, relation, and meaning-bearing coherence. Two identical words may represent different concepts depending on their structure and graph position.

## III. Supporting Notes

| Term / Phrase                   | Meaning / Source / Link |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Structural Node**             | A concept is a unit of meaning that maintains internal integrity |
| **Attributes / Methods**        | Inspired by OOP; concepts have properties and semantic actions |
| **Inheritance**                 | Conceptual structure may extend others (e.g., Tree → Oak) |
| **Conceptual Boundary**         | Prevents overload, ambiguity, or collapse (See: Boundary) |
| **Edge Relationships**          | All meaning arises from how concepts connect (See: Conceptual Graph) |
| **Traversal**                   | Concepts are only meaningful when activated through relational engagement |

## V. Examples and Use Cases

### 1. **The Concept of “Freedom”**
- Attributes: choice, constraint absence, scope  
- Relationships: law, society, power, self  
- Behaviors: can be granted, taken, expanded, misinterpreted  
- Traversal reveals contradictions and context dependency

### 2. **"Circle" in Math vs. "Circle" in Ritual**
- Identical label, distinct conceptual structures  
- One contains geometric rules; the other symbolic boundaries and roles  
- Each requires domain-specific traversal to understand

### 3. **AI Concepts**
- Trained models may create “concepts” by clustering features  
- Without clear boundaries or relational definitions, these may be shallow nodes—fragile or collapsible

### 4. **Metaphor as Conceptual Bridge**
- A metaphor activates a traversal between two conceptual graphs  
- Its power depends on the integrity of both nodes and the strength of the linking edge

## VI. Final Notes

Concepts are not names. They are **relational vessels of meaning** that grow, adapt, split, or collapse based on how they are structured, traversed, and integrated.

The collapse of a concept (e.g., through oversimplification, distortion, or severed edges) results in **semantic voids**—areas where meaning becomes inaccessible.

To preserve a concept is not to freeze it, but to **maintain its coherence while allowing for adaptive growth** through traversal and integration.
