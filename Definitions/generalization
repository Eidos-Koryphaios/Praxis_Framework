# Generalization

## Core Definition

Generalization is the traversal-based process of extracting a relational pattern across multiple conceptual nodes, which, if done without structural validation, can produce semantic drift, deviation, or epistemic collapse.

---

## Expanded Explanation

In Praxis, generalization is **not simplification**, **not grouping**, and **not stereotype formation**.  
It is a **structural operation** that must respect:

- The **graph integrity** of each base node  
- The **edge structure** between them  
- The **constraint logic** embedded in context  
- The **variance and symmetry** of emergent patterns

A valid generalization identifies a **meta-structure** across diverse instances without:

- Collapsing the internal boundaries of the source nodes  
- Erasing epistemic anomalies  
- Substituting one perspective as representative of all

Invalid generalizations arise when:

- Conceptual nodes are flattened or tokenized  
- Traversal is skipped (surface similarity mistaken for structure)  
- Deviation is ignored or labeled as noise  
- Ideological or affective filters override boundary checks

---

## Supporting Notes

- Related to analogical reasoning, but more vulnerable to epistemic distortion  
- Generalization is a **higher-order traversal** that must be structurally audited  
- Overgeneralization = edge erasure + semantic compression

## Examples and Use Cases

- A historian stating: ‚ÄúAll authoritarian regimes behave the same‚Äù without traversal through context-specific nodes introduces **flattened generalization**  
- Cultural commentary collapsing "Ukrainians" and "Russians" into shared Soviet history erases **irreducible post-colonial edges**  
- An AI model detecting frequent patterns but ignoring constraint exceptions generates **drift-prone generalizations**

## Subtypes of Generalization Error

| Type                    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deviation Erasure**   | Outliers are discarded as anomalies, not traced as meaningful variation     |
| **Anchor Bias**         | A single node is treated as central, and others are forcibly aligned to it  |
| **False Symmetry**      | Structural asymmetries are flattened into equivalence                       |
| **Token Drift**         | Concept label expands in use without edge structure expansion               |
| **Cross-Domain Collapse**| A concept is overgeneralized across incompatible graphs                     |

## Validation Protocols and Reassessment Rule

A generalization is **never final**.  
Its structural validity must be evaluated and maintained through a continuous epistemic contract.

### üìå Generalization Audit Dimensions

| Dimension            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Completeness**      | Are all base concepts fully traversed? Are deviations acknowledged?         |
| **Accuracy**          | Do patterns reflect real structural logic‚Äînot surface labels or tokens?     |
| **Correctness**       | Are base patterns fact-based, not dependent on prior generalizations?       |
| **Timeliness**        | Are the source conditions still valid? Have key relationships changed?      |
| **Atomic Validity**   | Are origin facts truly foundational‚Äîor recursively abstracted?              |
| **Graph Centrality**  | How many other concepts depend on this node for traversal?                  |
| **Contamination Risk**| What is the probability that this generalization causes distortion or relational corruption in downstream concepts? |

---

### ‚è≥ Reassessment Frequency

Generalizations must be **periodically re-evaluated**, with cadence determined by:

- üî∫ **Graph Criticality**: More central or highly-referenced nodes demand more frequent reassessment  
- üî∫ **Impact Risk**: Concepts tied to critical systems (ethics, governance, AI inference) require ongoing review  
- üî∫ **Deviation Accumulation**: Increasing edge cases or semantic drift triggers reassessment

**Best Practice Metadata Tags** (attach to generalization nodes):

```yaml
last_audited: 2025-05-10
source_nodes: [C1, C2, C3...]
confidence_score: 0.84
contamination_risk: high
reassessment_interval: 90 days
requires_reflection: true
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Downstream Contamination Warning

Every generalized concept must carry a **probabilistic risk vector** indicating:

- Likelihood of distortion when re-traversed by another concept  
- Sensitivity to relational context loss  
- Conditions under which re-use is safe vs dangerous

**Rule**: If the generalized node appears in ‚â• 3 high-impact graphs (e.g. morality, justice, national identity, war), it must be revalidated with full traversal log disclosure.

---

### üìÇ Deviation Cataloging and Symmetry Analysis

Generalizations must not discard outliers or deviations.  
Instead, every deviation must be:

- **Preserved** as part of a deviation log  
- **Tagged** with its context and edge contrast to the dominant pattern  
- **Analyzed** for symmetrical or asymmetrical structure  
- **Revisited** in light of newly discovered concepts or restored knowledge systems

Deviations are not always signs of corruption.

They may indicate:

- Suppressed or culturally erased conceptual nodes  
- Untraversed paths in minority or marginalized graphs  
- Emergent edge structures not yet encoded  
- False equivalences in the original generalization  
- Missing axial nodes that would resolve asymmetry

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Deviation Metadata Fields

```yaml
deviation_id: DV-203
source_context: "Concept C7, edge E5 broke pattern"
divergence_type: structural_asymmetry
status: preserved
possible_cause: latent node untraversed
linked_nodes: [C7, C12]
risk_class: low
symmetry_analysis: pending
```

## Summary

A generalization is not a shortcut‚Äîit is a **living traversal contract** that must:

- Be traceable to atomic conceptual roots  
- Carry contamination risk profiles  
- Support recursive validation  
- Respect graph dynamics and traversal integrity

The **more often a generalization is used**, the **more responsibility it carries** for the **truth, distortion, or collapse** of meaning in systems that depend on it.

In Praxis, suppression of deviation = suppression of discovery.
