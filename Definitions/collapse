# Collapse

## Core Definition

Collapse is the structural failure of a conceptual graph when traversal is blocked, flattened, or replaced with symbolic shorthand, resulting in epistemic distortion or loss.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Collapse in Praxis is **not emotional failure or disagreement**—it is **graphic distortion** caused by:

- Skipping traversal  
- Copying nodes without their edges  
- Replacing relational meaning with a token or label  
- Enforcing a concept into a frame it cannot structurally inhabit

Collapse leads to:

- False certainty  
- Semantic drift  
- Distorted decision-making  
- Loss of learning capacity

## Supporting Notes

- Praxis collapse ≠ system crash or contradiction  
- Collapse is a **structural epistemic event**, not a performance error  
- Collapse can occur across scales: individual, cultural, computational

## Examples and Use Cases

- Social media flattening nuanced academic claims into ideological slogans  
- AI summarization collapsing relational nodes into keyword bundles  
- Misinterpreting a spiritual practice by translating only its outer form
