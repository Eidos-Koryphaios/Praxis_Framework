# Concept

## Core Definition

A concept is a structurally bounded, relationally traversable node of meaning within a conceptual graph.

## Expanded Explanation

In Praxis, a concept is not a word, label, or symbol—but a **relational construct** that arises from the structured alignment of meaning.  
Each concept consists of internal structure (attributes, behaviors, boundaries) and external structure (edges to other concepts).

A concept must be:

- Structurally **irreducible**  
- **Traversable** through intentional, relational activation  
- **Bounded** to prevent semantic drift or infinite expansion  
- **Integrated** into a graph of meaning, never isolated

Concepts are the **building blocks of intelligence**—but only gain full coherence through their placement within a **relational graph**.

## Supporting Notes

- Origin: Latin *conceptum* (something conceived, grasped)  
- Structural analogy: 
  - Like a class in OOP (attributes + methods)
  - Like a node in a graph (edges + traversal rules)
- Concepts may have:
  - Subnodes (internal concepts)
  - Constraints (temporal, contextual, epistemic)
  - Hidden or suppressed traversal edges

## Examples and Use Cases

- **"Justice"** as a concept cannot be reduced to "fairness"; it contains internal tensions, constraints, and multi-node traversal.
- A concept like **"Gravity"** links physical observation, mathematics, metaphor, and cultural story nodes.
- AI systems that treat concepts as tokens rather than relational graphs risk epistemic collapse.
