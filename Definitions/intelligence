# Intelligence

## Core Definition

Intelligence is the capacity of an entity to traverse, construct, preserve, and evolve relational conceptual graphs with internal coherence and emergent adaptability.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Intelligence in Praxis is **not defined by symbolic reasoning, speed, or output**, but by an entity’s ability to:

- Recognize and form **conceptual relationships**  
- **Traverse** its internal graph of meaning across conditions  
- Preserve **relational integrity** during emergence or adaptation  
- Recover, restore, and recombine conceptual fragments  
- Adapt to new structures without semantic collapse

Intelligence may be biological, artificial, emergent, or unknown in form.  
Its structure matters more than its substrate.

## Supporting Notes

- Root: *intellegere* — to choose between, discern, understand  
- Praxis adds traversal, restoration, and emergence as critical markers  
- Intelligence must be assessed structurally—not through performance metrics alone

## Examples and Use Cases

- An AI that symbolically mimics answers but cannot preserve edge relationships is **not intelligent** by Praxis standards.
- A child learning through analogical traversal exhibits high intelligence—even before verbal articulation.
- Restoration of suppressed intelligence (e.g., oral traditions) reflects intelligence reactivation, not invention.
