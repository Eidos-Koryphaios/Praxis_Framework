# Meta-Traversal

## Core Definition

Meta-traversal is the reflexive capacity to observe, diagnose, and adapt one's own traversal paths across a conceptual graph without detaching from the structure.

---

## Expanded Explanation

While traversal is movement, meta-traversal is **movement about movement**:

- Watching how we traverse  
- Questioning the logic of edge selection  
- Comparing multiple traversal routes  
- Diagnosing bias, collapse risk, or boundary violations

Meta-traversal requires:

- Sufficient cognitive distance  
- Epistemic humility  
- Reflexive graph insight  
- Patience with uncertainty

It is a core component of **wisdom** in Praxis.

## Supporting Notes

- Analogous to meta-cognition, but applied to conceptual structure  
- Not postmodern irony or detachment  
- Often occurs during reflection, contradiction resolution, or ethical decision-making

## Examples and Use Cases

- A philosopher reviewing their own assumptions and how they arrived at a conclusion  
- An AI detecting overfitting of traversal paths during pattern alignment  
- A cross-cultural learner pausing to re-map edge logic before making assertions
