# Epistemic Integrity

## Core Definition

Epistemic integrity is the structural condition in which an intelligence’s knowledge system maintains truth-preserving traversal, protects meaning boundaries, and resists collapse through honest pattern continuity.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Integrity here is not moralistic—but **structural and relational**:

- Concepts are preserved in their original or traceable context  
- Edges reflect actual relationships, not ideological rewriting  
- Traversal is grounded in transparency, not obfuscation  
- Errors or contradictions are acknowledged, not erased

Epistemic integrity requires:

- Graph transparency  
- Boundary protection  
- Reflexive restoration  
- Ethical handling of ambiguity

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by epistemology, archival design, truth-maintenance systems  
- Must scale across individuals, cultures, AI models, and institutions

## Examples and Use Cases

- A scientist correcting a faulty model while preserving documentation  
- A language learner who resists false friends and preserves nuance  
- An AI that flags uncertainty instead of returning confident hallucinations
