# Graph Integrity

## Core Definition

Graph integrity is the state in which a conceptual graph preserves its internal relationships, traversal paths, and boundaries without symbolic distortion or external override.

---

## Expanded Explanation

A graph with integrity:

- Maintains all relevant **edges** and **node boundaries**  
- Enables **context-aware traversal**  
- Resists substitution, tokenization, and collapse  
- Can evolve, but not through overwrite or erasure

Graph integrity does not mean fixityâ€”it means **relational coherence and self-consistency**.

## Supporting Notes

- Inspired by ideas from data validation, narrative theory, and epistemic ethics  
- Applies to cognitive systems, AI models, cultural systems, and languages

## Examples and Use Cases

- A language losing its metaphoric structure has lost graph integrity  
- An AI model trained to compress meaning into keywords suffers integrity collapse  
- Human memory networks fractured by trauma or propaganda show degraded graph integrity
