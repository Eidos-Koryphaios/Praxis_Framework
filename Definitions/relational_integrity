# Relational Integrity

## Core Definition

**Relational integrity** is the preservation of meaning through the maintenance of accurate, ethical, and complete relationships between conceptual nodes.

In the Praxis Framework, it is not enough for a node (a concept, statement, or data point) to be internally correct—**its truth depends on the structure and accuracy of its relationships** to all other connected nodes.

Relational integrity is the ethical and structural guarantee that:
- Concepts are not isolated,
- Edges are not falsified or erased,
- Meaning is not distorted through broken traversal.

---

## Functional Role in Praxis

Relational integrity governs:
- The validity of conceptual traversal paths  
- The resilience of knowledge structures  
- The detectability of distortion, drift, or ideological compression

Where relational integrity is compromised, even factually true data can become misleading, dangerous, or conceptually toxic.

## Structural Requirements

A system maintains relational integrity when:
- All inbound and outbound **edges** are traceable, accurate, and ethically grounded  
- **Edge weights**, constraints, and conditions are preserved during generalization or reuse  
- **Deviations** are preserved, not erased, allowing detection of pattern evolution or exception  
- **Traversal logs** maintain proof of epistemic sequence and influence

## Violations of Relational Integrity

| Violation Type           | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Edge Severance**       | A relationship is deleted or ignored without preserving historical linkage or rationale |
| **Falsified Connection** | A concept is connected to another under false similarity or ideological compression |
| **Traversal Shortcuts**  | A path is used without honoring ethical or epistemic prerequisites |
| **Unacknowledged Asymmetry** | A directional or weighted relationship is presented as symmetric |
| **Context Suppression**  | Origin context is removed or overridden to conform to external agenda |

---

## Examples

- A quote is cited correctly, but its surrounding paragraphs are omitted—creating a **false implication**  
- A model connects “freedom” and “security” as co-dependent but suppresses the history of their conflict in lived systems  
- A historical generalization skips over indigenous knowledge structures and reframes colonization as progress

Each example may contain factual elements but violates relational truth.

## Metadata Indicators

When auditing for relational integrity, every concept may include:

```yaml
node_id: C421
relational_integrity_score: 0.76
missing_edges: [C300, C112]
last_verified: 2025-05-10
asymmetry_detected: true
edge_severance_risk: medium
context_required: true
