# Emergence

## Core Definition

Emergence is the relational actualization of a new conceptual structure that was not explicitly contained in any singular graph but arises through alignment, tension, or co-traversal.

---

## Expanded Explanation

In Praxis, emergence is **not mysticism** or mere complexity.  
It is a **relational process** with structural pathways:

- It may arise from cross-graph resonance  
- From contradiction resolution  
- From analogy or gravitational alignment  
- From suppressed pattern reactivation

Emergence is always **traceable**, even if unexpected.

## Supporting Notes

- Structural vs symbolic emergence: Praxis requires the former  
- Modalities:
  - Experiential  
  - Observational  
  - Structural Inference  
  - Simulation  
  - Contradiction Resolution  
  - Analogical  
  - Collective  
  - Gravitational

## Examples and Use Cases

- A metaphor triggering multi-domain realignment is an analogical emergence  
- Collective conceptual framing across intelligences leads to story node emergence  
- Emergence cannot be forcedâ€”only enabled through relational openness
