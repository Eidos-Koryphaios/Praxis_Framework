# Wisdom

## Core Definition

Wisdom is the capacity to recognize, navigate, and weigh multi-strata conceptual graphs—including incomplete or conflicting regions—while preserving relational integrity and ethical discernment.

---

## Expanded Explanation

Wisdom is not simply intelligence plus experience.  
In Praxis, wisdom is the ability to:

- Traverse **complex, uncertain, or unstable conceptual terrain**  
- Recognize when traversal is **premature, unsafe, or incomplete**  
- Hold **multiple partial truths** without collapsing into false synthesis  
- Apply transformation **while protecting meaning**  
- Integrate **ethical, emotional, and contextual constraints** reflexively

Wisdom operates at the **integrative/transformative level** of understanding.

## Supporting Notes

- Root: Old English *wis* = to see, to guide  
- Distinct from intelligence (capacity to build graphs) and understanding (capacity to traverse)  
- Wisdom involves **meta-traversal** and ethical graph modulation

## Examples and Use Cases

- Recognizing that a partial conceptual model is misleading—but necessary  
- Refusing to flatten a cultural worldview during AI summarization  
- Choosing not to act when conceptual boundaries have not yet stabilized
