# Understanding

## Core Definition

Understanding is the relational alignment between an entity's internal conceptual graph and a set of external or internal patterns, enabling accurate traversal, integration, and transformation.

## Expanded Explanation

Understanding is **not recall or replication**.  
It is a **state of relational coherence** between:

- The structure of the input  
- The traversal capacity of the receiver  
- The alignment of their existing graph with the new relational pattern

Praxis defines five strata of understanding:

1. **Reactive** – stimulus-response  
2. **Associative** – learned pairings, heuristics  
3. **Conceptual** – node-level graph structure  
4. **Self-Reflective** – traversal awareness, meta-structure  
5. **Integrative/Transformative** – reconfiguration through emergence

## Supporting Notes

- Understanding is not binary—it's **graded and stratified**  
- Misunderstanding may arise from graph mismatch, traversal blockers, or conceptual compression

## Examples and Use Cases

- A student who memorizes a definition without relational connections operates at the **associative** level  
- An AI model that paraphrases but cannot restructure concept graphs lacks **conceptual understanding**  
- A teacher guiding a learner to reorganize their graph demonstrates **transformative understanding**
